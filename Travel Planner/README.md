##  Project Overview

**Travel Planner** is a full-stack web application that revolutionizes the way users plan their trips.  
Traditionally, travelers rely on multiple platforms—flights, hotels, maps, weather forecasts—which makes planning fragmented and time-consuming.  
Our system introduces an **AI-powered solution using Google’s Gemini LLM**, enabling **smart, personalized, and automated itinerary generation**.

Through natural language prompts such as *destination*, *duration*, *budget*, and *preferences*, users can generate a **structured, day-by-day itinerary** that integrates **real-world data** like maps and weather.  

This project was developed as a **college group project** under the Department of Data Science and AI, IIIT Dharwad.

##  Research Background

This project builds upon recent advances in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **AI-driven personalization**.  
It explores how generative AI (like **Gemini**) can understand user context and produce coherent, multi-day travel itineraries automatically.

Compared to traditional tools like **MakeMyTrip** or **Expedia**, which primarily focus on bookings, our system emphasizes **planning intelligence** — combining AI reasoning with live data sources.

##  Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Analytics** – Suggest best travel times and deals using data-driven insights.  
- **AR Integration** – Overlay landmark information and translations in real time.  
- **Social & Gamified Features** – Enable trip sharing, badges, and collaborative planning.  
- **Sustainability Metrics** – Display carbon footprint and eco-friendly suggestions.  
- **Advanced LLM Memory** – Enable context retention for returning users.  

---

##  Limitations

- Dependence on third-party APIs (Google, Weather) for data integrity.  
- Current model uses general-purpose LLM (**Gemini**) without domain-specific fine-tuning.  
- Limited real-world user testing — future iterations aim for larger-scale evaluation.  
- Potential for minor inaccuracies in generated itineraries due to generative variability.  

---

##  Conclusion

**Travel Planner** demonstrates how **LLMs** and **AI services** can transform trip planning into an intelligent, interactive, and effortless experience.  
By integrating modern web technologies with **generative AI**, the system bridges the gap between **research and real-world usability**, offering travelers a **personalized planning assistant** that adapts to their needs.  

This project establishes a strong foundation for future work in **LLM-powered personalization**, **conversational travel agents**, and **AI-based decision-making systems**.
